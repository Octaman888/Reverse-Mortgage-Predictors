Helping people live in their homes for longer periods of time; and RM are becoming an ever more important financial tool among many retirees to better help fund their golden years.

Americans continue to build their largest equity source and safety net via their homes at an increasing rate.

Debt to income ratio does not seem to effect RM prediction.

income does not seem to predict RM.

Existing RM are on lower end of price spectrum < $250k and increasing in $ as new persons reach age 62 (see line 8)

Tableau findings/indications/demonstrations verified by P values in Logistic regression model in showing the relevant influential categorical informational aspects(see coloab informational coding).

RM accounted for %.2 of all mortgages for 2020 in Bexar County, indicating huge untapped potential in now and in coming years as baby boomer population continues to  reach the age of 62.
